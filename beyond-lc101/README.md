# Beyond LC101 - Java

This cheat sheet is a collection of links and resources you may find helpful as you continue your LaunchCode process and your career.

## Resources

### Great Java Blogs

[DZone](https://dzone.com/java-jdk-development-tutorials-tools-news)

### Spring Tutorials

Protip: As you scour the edges of the internet in search of tutorials and answers, beware of dated documentation, especially around Spring. A good rule of thumb, is if you see XML configuring Spring, it's probably not what you're looking for.

[Spring.io](http://spring.io/guides) A great way to learn about other tools built into Spring Boot. Interesting additional topics include building and consuming REST services, accessing FB data, and Spring Security. At the bottom, you'll find more complete tutorials that dig in deeper to topics like REST architecture, Security with OAuth2 (i.e. FB login), as well as integrating with front end frameworks like React and Angular.

### Testing

[Unit and Integration Tests](https://dzone.com/articles/unit-and-integration-tests-in-spring-boot) Writing tests for your applications have countless benefits. It's much quicker to write a unit test around functionality than it is to start up your web server, setup your data, and manually test functionality. As an added bonus, tests act as a great indicator that you might have broken unrelated functionality.

[Test Driven Development](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) Tests are _so_ beneficial, that many believe you should write your tests first. TDD helps you define how your functionality behaves before you start coding it.

### Front End

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) If you're interested in making your Thymeleaf project mobile friendly, Bootstrap can provide the framework necessary to make sure your web app looks great on mobile too! Bootstrap is also used by many other front end languages and templating frameworks, so it's a portable skill that can give your web app that extra pop!

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) jQuery is a great, all-purpose JavaScript library to either supplement Thymeleaf, or build your own front end.

[Spring Boot and jQuery](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-cli-and-js/)

### Cloud

[Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry/introduction) Learn how to run your apps with Cloud Foundry, hosted by Pivotal Web Services. Cloud Foundry can be used in many environments, including AWS and Azure, but Pivotal is fastest way to get your projects hosted.

## Stay Connected

[LaunchCode Slack](https://launchcode-community.herokuapp.com/) Stay connected with LaunchCode post LC101. Share articles and resources. Ask questions. Look at cat pictures!

[StlTech Slack](https://stltech.herokuapp.com/) St. Louis Tech's largest Slack community. Network! Find a meetup! Argue over tabs vs spaces!

[Meetup.com](www.foo.com) Most area tech meetups are advertised on Meetup.com. Be sure to check out these that might be of interest:

* [St. Louis Java User's Group](https://www.meetup.com/GatewayJUG/) Come for the presentation, stay for the door prizes!
* [St. Louis Full Stack](https://www.meetup.com/SaintLouis_FullStack_WebDevelopment/) Leverage your front end and back end skills.
* [St. Louis Groovy & Grails Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/st-louis-groovy-and-grails-meetup/) Groovy is scripting language (somewhat like Python in some regards) but leverages the power of the JVM and is very accessible for Java developers. Grails is a great tool to help you quickly build apps.
* [St. Louis Machine Learning & Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/St-Louis-Machine-Learning/)
* [DevOps STL](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-STL/) Use your coding skills to tackle operational concerns and make all the gears turn smoothly.

### Soft Skills

[Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) Working without the help of TFs and classmates can be intimidating. Grab a rubber duck, and be amazed at the fact that YOU'VE GOT THIS! Having to actually explain what your code does (out loud!) forces you to understand what your code is doing, and you'd be surprised at how effective this is at helping you catch your mistakes.

[Pair Programming](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/effective-navigation-in-pair-programming) Learn some great practices for 'pairing up' with a peer.

[Scrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRcReyRYIMg) Many shops utilize some form of 'Agile' development to quickly build and iterate projects. Scrum is one such implementation of this. Learning how to identify a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and how to break down large goals into smaller manageable tasks is a great skill to master for both professional, and personal projects.
